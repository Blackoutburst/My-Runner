# My Runner
My Runner (a.k.a PowerRun) is a Epitech school project, this is a game based on Geometry dash created for school.

## Gameplay
Simply use spacebar or up arrow to jump or switch gravity. Blue Block make you jump if you jump on them, Green block reverse gravity if you jump on them and red block kill you if you touch them, I made the hitbox really special to make the game more easy
